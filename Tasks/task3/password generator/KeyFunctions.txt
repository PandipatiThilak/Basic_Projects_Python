1. generatePassword(pwlength)
This function generates passwords based on the provided lengths.

Parameters:

pwlength (list of int): A list of integers representing the desired lengths of the passwords.
Functionality:

Initializes an alphabet string containing all lowercase letters.
Iterates through the provided lengths.
For each length, generates a password by randomly selecting characters from the alphabet.
Replaces some characters with numbers and uppercase letters.
Returns a list of generated passwords.
Code:


def generatePassword(pwlength):
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    passwords = []
    for i in pwlength:
        password = ""
        for j in range(i):
            next_letter_index = random.randrange(len(alphabet))
            password = password + alphabet[next_letter_index]
        password = replaceWithNumber(password)
        password = replaceWithUppercaseLetter(password)
        passwords.append(password)
    return passwords
2. replaceWithNumber(pword)
This function replaces random characters in the first half of the password with numbers.

Parameters:

pword (str): The password string to modify.
Functionality:

Randomly selects a number of replacements (between 1 and 2).
Replaces characters in the first half of the password with random digits.
Returns the modified password.
Code:


def replaceWithNumber(pword):
    for i in range(random.randrange(1,3)):
        replace_index = random.randrange(len(pword)//2)
        pword = pword[0:replace_index] + str(random.randrange(10)) + pword[replace_index+1:]
        return pword  # Incorrect indentation limits the function to only one replacement
3. replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword)
This function replaces random characters in the second half of the password with uppercase letters.

Parameters:

pword (str): The password string to modify.
Functionality:

Randomly selects a number of replacements (between 1 and 2).
Replaces characters in the second half of the password with their uppercase equivalents.
Returns the modified password.
Code:


def replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword):
    for i in range(random.randrange(1,3)):
        replace_index = random.randrange(len(pword)//2, len(pword))
        pword = pword[0:replace_index] + pword[replace_index].upper() + pword[replace_index+1:]
        return pword  # Incorrect indentation limits the function to only one replacement
4. main()
This function is the main entry point of the program, handling user interaction and calling other functions.

Functionality:

Prompts the user for the number of passwords to generate.
Ensures the minimum length of passwords is 3.
Collects the desired lengths for each password.
Calls generatePassword to generate the passwords.
Prints each generated password.
Code:


def main():
    numPasswords = int(input("How many passwords do you want to generate? "))
    print("Generating " + str(numPasswords) + " passwords")
    passwordLengths = []
    print("Minimum length of password should be 3")
    for i in range(numPasswords):
        length = int(input("Enter the length of Password #" + str(i+1) + " "))
        if length < 3:
            length = 3
        passwordLengths.append(length)
    Password = generatePassword(passwordLengths)
    for i in range(numPasswords):
        print("Password #" + str(i+1) + " = " + Password[i])

main()
Summary of Key Functions:
generatePassword(pwlength)

Generates passwords with lowercase letters, numbers, and uppercase letters.
Calls replaceWithNumber and replaceWithUppercaseLetter to modify passwords.
replaceWithNumber(pword)

Replaces characters in the first half of the password with random digits.
Incorrect indentation limits it to a single replacement.
replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword)

Replaces characters in the second half of the password with uppercase letters.
Incorrect indentation limits it to a single replacement.
main()

Handles user input and coordinates the generation and printing of passwords.
These functions together form the core logic of the password generator, with generatePassword being the central function supported by replaceWithNumber and replaceWithUppercaseLetter for modifying the passwords.
